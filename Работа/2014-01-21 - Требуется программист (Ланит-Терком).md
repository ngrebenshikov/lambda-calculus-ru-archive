Team   
  
All programmers on the team have passed a very hard programming test because having the best programmers allows us to use very agile principles, and grant the individual programmer a large degree of freedom and influence on their work. We have automatic build, testing and deployment systems, which allow us to deploy your work safely to production daily without red tape or other unnecessary obstacles to changing the world. Successful candidates will join a distributed team of 25 very highly skilled programmers in St. Petersburg, Copenhagen and Abakan. We work together in an agile fashion, using Skype, bug tracking systems, etc. You will get the privilege of working with other top programmers under very competent technical management, and no clueless project managers. We use many different technologies, and many of us do functional programming. This setup means you will have much autonomy and be allowed to plan your work hours yourself. Programmers on the team have a lot of freedom. That of course, comes with a high level of responsibility.   
  
There may be some travel to Copenhagen or the U. S.
